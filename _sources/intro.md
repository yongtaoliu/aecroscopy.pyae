# Welcome to AEcroscopy for Automated and Autonomous Microscopy

Under construction
(Here, we will introduce automated and autonomous experiment, the requirement of autonomous experiment, the objective of AEcroscopy... )

AEcroscopy is a cutting-edge Python package that integrates with our self-developed Application Programming Interface (API) BEPyAE,aiming to revolutionizing microscopy measurements. AEcroscopy enables easy implementation of experiments formulated with Python program......allowing users to orchestrate complex experiments, design workflows, and gather data more efficiently. 

In addition, AEcroscopy allows users to integrate machine leanring models into the operating experiment, harnessing the power of AI for real-time data analysis and decision-making. This will enable rapid iterations in experiment and largely accelerate scientific discovery.

With AEcroscopy, a microscopy capable of automating operation, actively learning from on-the-fly results, adapting experiments, optimizing parameters, driving real-time decision-making... becomes a reality.

Discover the potential of AEcroscopy and experience the future of microscopy experimentation.
