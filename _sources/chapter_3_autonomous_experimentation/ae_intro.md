# About Autonomous Experiment

Autonomous experiments integrate artifical intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for data analysis, decision-making, optimization, and adaption to enable experiments without human intervention.

In this chapter, we will introduce ML-driven experiment workflows constructed with AEcroscopy for autonomous microscopy experiments.
