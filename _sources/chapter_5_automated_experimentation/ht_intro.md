# About Automated Experiment

Automated experiments perform tasks with minimum or no human intervention to improve efficiency and precision. An example of automated experiment is high-throughput experiment, which automates and accelerates data acquisition and analysis, allowing researchers to rapidly gather substantial data and gain valuable insights into materials properties. In high-throughput microscopy experiments, data can be efficiently collected from multiple sample sites, or in a significantly faster sequential manner. The automated data acquisition manner minimizes human intervention, reducing the risk of errors caused by human factors, improving reproducibility, and enhancing the efficiency.

In this chapter, we will introduce workflows constructed with AEcroscopy for automated microscopy experiments.
